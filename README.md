## Description

At the end of our sixth week on the course we started to generate ideas for our second project. The project was to create a MEN stack CRUD app. 

## Deployment link

## Getting Started/Code Istallation

## Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)

This is a solo project and we were given 8 days to work on it.

## Technologies Used

## Brief

- The app utilizes EJS Templates for rendering views to users.
- The app uses session-based authentication.
- The appâ€™s files are organized following the       conventions taught in lectures.
- The app has at least one data entity in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
- The app has full CRUD functionality.
- Authorization is implemented in the app. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
- The app is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.
